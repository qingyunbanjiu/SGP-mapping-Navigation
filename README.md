# SGP-mapping-Navigation
Cross-Domain Aware Mapless Navigation Framework for Amphibious Robots Based on Sparse Gaussian Process Mapping
This project provides a Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP)-based dynamic mapping and D* Lite path planning framework for both simulation and real-world deployment, tailored for complex environments including landâ€“water transition scenarios.
To run the simulation:
Install the required PyTorch version compatible with your system.
Clone this repository and ensure all dependencies (e.g., NumPy, matplotlib, etc.) are installed.
Download the sample environment point cloud data.
Run the following command:python d_star_lite_path_planning.py
